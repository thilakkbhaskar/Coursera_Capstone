Select a spot that can be seen by those driving or walking by. You should also look for an area that gets plenty of passersby on foot or in cars. In addition, consider if there is parking and ease of access by foot or car.\n3.\tThe demographics. Ensure the target market of your restaurant matches the demographics of the area.\n4.\tLabor costs and minimum wage. It\u2019s important to ensure that the labor costs of an area don\u2019t cut into your profits. You will also want to have an idea of what employees might expect to make based on the location.\n5.\tThe competition of the area. Some nearby competition can help with marketing. But it\u2019s wise to have enough of a distance that you can still guarantee a solid pool of customers who won\u2019t be easily drawn to another similar place.\n",
